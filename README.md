Welcome to DecoPro! This project consists of a Unity app for interior design visualization using Augmented Reality (AR) and a Next.js landing page to showcase the app and provide information to users.

## Overview

DecoPro aims to revolutionize the way users visualize and plan interior design projects. The Unity app allows users to experience lifelike representations of furniture and decor items in their own spaces using augmented reality. On the other hand, the Next.js landing page serves as a central hub for project information, user testimonials, and more.
